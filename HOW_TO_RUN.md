==========

## Release mode

To view the 'finished' application as an executable file which can be run on Windows/Mac/Linux platforms visit the [releases page](https://github.com/georgePadolsey/ComputerScience2018/releases)<sup>1</sup> on the GitHub repo.

Choose the latest version and appropriate file for your platform. (i.e. `.exe` for Windows etc.)

## Development mode

### Requirements
To be able to run this on your computer in development mode. You must have:

### Steps
To view the 'finished' application in `development` mode where code can be change and debugging tools are available either:
- Visit the GitHub [releases page](https://github.com/georgePadolsey/ComputerScience2018/releases)<sup>1</sup> and download the latest source code (the zip file)
- Clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/georgePadolsey/ComputerScience2018)<sup>6</sup>. To see a tutorial for how to do this go to the Github [Help page](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)<sup>7</sup>

Then run the following commands from the main directory:
